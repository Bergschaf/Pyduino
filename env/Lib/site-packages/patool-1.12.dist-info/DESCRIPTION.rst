Various archive formats can be created, extracted, tested, listed,
searched, compared and repacked by patool. The advantage of patool
is its simplicity in handling archive files without having to remember
a myriad of programs and options.

The archive format is determined by the file(1) program and as a
fallback by the archive file extension.

patool supports 7z (.7z), ACE (.ace), ADF (.adf), ALZIP (.alz), APE (.ape),
AR (.a), ARC (.arc), ARJ (.arj), BZIP2 (.bz2),
CAB (.cab), COMPRESS (.Z), CPIO (.cpio),
DEB (.deb), DMS (.dms), FLAC (.flac), GZIP (.gz), ISO (.iso), LRZIP (.lrz),
LZH (.lha, .lzh), LZIP (.lz), LZMA (.lzma), LZOP (.lzo), RPM (.rpm),
RAR (.rar), RZIP (.rz), SHN (.shn), TAR (.tar), XZ (.xz), ZIP (.zip, .jar),
ZOO (.zoo) and ZPAQ (.zpaq) formats.
It relies on helper applications to handle those archive formats
(for example bzip2 for BZIP2 archives).

The archive formats TAR, ZIP, BZIP2 and GZIP
are supported natively and do not require helper applications to be
installed.
